# Perfanalytics

## Overview

[**Perfanalytics**](https://github.com/Trendyol/perfanalytics) was created to measure and monitor web applications' performance in one place. Also Perfanalytics can be used to report unexpected performance incidents.

### Motivation

Today, **performance** is one of the most important factors in web applications, and we want to be able to follow how a new feature or any change in our constantly changing and developing web applications affects performance in a good or bad way. For this, we have created a tool that makes **performance measurements** at desired time intervals and visualizes them.
